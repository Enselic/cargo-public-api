//! This library gives you the public API of a library crate, in the form of a
//! list of public items in the crate. Public items are items that other crates
//! can use. Diffing is also supported.
//!
//! If you want a convenient CLI for this library, you should use [cargo
//! public-api](https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api).
//!
//! As input to the library, a special output format from `cargo doc` is used,
//! which goes by the name **rustdoc JSON**. Currently, only `cargo doc` from
//! the Nightly toolchain can produce **rustdoc JSON** for a library. You build
//! **rustdoc JSON** like this:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo +nightly rustdoc --lib -- -Z unstable-options --output-format json
//! ```
//!
//! Consider using [`rustdoc_json`](https://crates.io/crates/rustdoc_json)
//! instead of invoking the above command yourself.
//!
//! The main entry point to the library is [`PublicApi::from_rustdoc_json_str`],
//! so please read its documentation.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The two main use cases are listing the public API and diffing different
//! versions of the same public APIs.
//!
//! ## List all public items of a crate (the public API)
//! ```no_run
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/list_public_api.rs")]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Diff two versions of a public API
//! ```no_run
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/diff_public_api.rs")]
//! ```
//!
//! The most comprehensive example code on how to use the library can be found
//! in the thin binary wrapper around the library, see
//! <https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/blob/main/public-api/src/main.rs>.
